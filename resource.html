    <h3> Presistence</h3>
        <p><h5>An example of persistence <br>
            is when you try and try to learn a new skill, <br>
            never giving up.<br>
             An example of persistence is <br>when a marital problem doesn't go away even after the divorce is finalized. <br>
             The property of being persistent</h5>

        <p><h5>Even when on shaky ground<br>
                or as a soldier when around you things drop your hope  looks grimm <br>and smiles turns to frowns <br>
             never give up but continue to push, persist and climb .<br>
             Because at the journeys end  there is victory for your grind<br> So when you seem to fail, <br>
             try again like babies do. <br>
             It's about staying on it and giving it your all.</h5>
